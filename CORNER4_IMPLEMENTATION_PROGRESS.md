### **Task 2: AP Inbox APIs** ‚úÖ 100% Complete

**New REST Endpoints (6 total):**

#### **1. POST /inward-invoices/receive**
- **Purpose:** Receive invoices from suppliers (PEPPOL or manual entry)
- **Features:**
  - Validates customer TRN matches company TRN
  - Prevents duplicate invoices (supplier + invoice number)
  - Saves UBL XML with hash verification
  - **Automatic PO matching** by supplier TRN
  - Calculates amount variance
  - Determines matching status (FULL_MATCH, VARIANCE_DETECTED, PARTIAL_MATCH)
  - Creates line items from provided data
  - Updates PO counters (received_invoice_count, received_amount_total)

**Matching Logic:**
- Full Match: Variance < 1 cent (AED 0.01)
- Variance Detected: Variance < 5% of expected
- Partial Match: Variance > 5%
- Not Matched: No matching PO found

#### **2. GET /inward-invoices**
- **Purpose:** List all inward invoices (AP Inbox)
- **Query Filters:**
  - `status`: RECEIVED, PENDING_REVIEW, APPROVED, etc.
  - `supplier_trn`: Filter by supplier
  - `matching_status`: Filter by matching result
- **Returns:** Lightweight list with key fields (invoice number, supplier, amount, status, matching status, PO ID)
- **Ordering:** Most recent first (by received_at DESC)

#### **3. GET /inward-invoices/{invoice_id}**
- **Purpose:** Get full details of a specific inward invoice
- **Returns:** Complete invoice object including:
  - All financial details
  - PEPPOL transmission data
  - Matching results and variances
  - Approval/rejection audit trail
  - Payment tracking
  - Dispute information
  - Full line items with PO/GRN links

#### **4. POST /inward-invoices/{invoice_id}/approve**

- **Features:**
  - Changes status to APPROVED
  - Records approver (user ID + timestamp)
  - Optional notes, payment method, payment reference
  - Updates PO matched_invoice_count
  - Prevents approving already-approved or rejected invoices

#### **5. POST /inward-invoices/{invoice_id}/reject**
- **Purpose:** Reject invoice with mandatory reason
- **Features:**
  - Changes status to REJECTED
  - Records reviewer (user ID + timestamp)
  - Requires rejection_reason (mandatory)
  - Optional additional notes
  - Prevents rejecting paid invoices

#### **6. POST /inward-invoices/{invoice_id}/match-po**
- **Purpose:** Manually match invoice to a purchase order
- **Features:**
  - Validates supplier TRN matches between invoice and PO
  - Calculates amount variance
  - Determines matching status
  - Computes match score (0-100%)
  - Updates both invoice and PO records
  - Prevents mismatched suppliers

**Match Score Calculation:**
```
match_score = 100% - min(|variance / expected_total| * 100%, 100%)
```
