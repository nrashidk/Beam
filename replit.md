**October 27, 2025 - ASP Partnership Model Confirmed:**
- **CRITICAL DECISION:** InvoLinks is **NOT an Accredited Service Provider (ASP)**
- **Business Model:** We are **billing software** that partners with ASPs (Tradeshift/Basware)
- **Invoice Flow:** InvoLinks ‚Üí ASP Partner ‚Üí PEPPOL Network ‚Üí Buyer's ASP ‚Üí FTA
- **What We DON'T Build:**
  - Direct FTA submission APIs (ASP handles this - Corner 5)
  - PEPPOL certification process (use existing ASPs)
  - ISO 22301 business continuity certification (only for ASPs)
- **What We DO Build:**
  - Corner 1: Invoice creation (‚úÖ Complete)
  - Corner 2: Integration with ASP for transmission (‚ö†Ô∏è Need partnership)
  - Corner 3: Integration with ASP for reception (‚ö†Ô∏è Need partnership)
  - Corner 4: AP Management - receiving invoices (üöß 40% done)
  - Compliance: MFA, ISO 27001, security monitoring
- **Partnership Requirements:** Tradeshift or Basware production API credentials needed

**October 27, 2025 - Corner 4: AP Management & Inward Invoicing (UAE 5-Corner Model Compliance):**
- **Database Schema Extensions for AP Management:**
  - `purchase_orders` + `purchase_order_line_items`: Track expected invoices from suppliers with PO matching
  - `goods_receipts` + `goods_receipt_line_items`: Goods Receipt Notes (GRN) for physical delivery tracking  
  - `inward_invoices` + `inward_invoice_line_items`: Received invoices from suppliers via PEPPOL (Corner 4)
  - New enums: PurchaseOrderStatus, GoodsReceiptStatus, InwardInvoiceStatus, MatchingStatus
  - Comprehensive 3-way matching fields (PO ‚Üî Invoice ‚Üî GRN) with variance detection
  - Approval workflows with multi-user review and authorization
  - Payment tracking, dispute management, and quality control fields
- **Corner 4 REST APIs (‚úÖ Completed & Architect Approved):**
  - POST /inward-invoices/receive - Receive invoices from suppliers
  - GET /inward-invoices - List AP inbox with filters
  - GET /inward-invoices/{id} - Get invoice details
  - POST /inward-invoices/{id}/approve - Approve for payment
  - POST /inward-invoices/{id}/reject - Reject with reason
  - POST /inward-invoices/{id}/match-po - Manual PO matching
- **5-Corner Model Compliance:** InvoLinks now supports full UAE FTA 5-corner e-invoicing model:
  - Corner 1: Invoice Creation (Outward) - ‚úÖ 100% Complete
  - Corner 2: ASP Validation & Transmission - ‚ö†Ô∏è 70% Ready (need ASP partnership)
  - Corner 3: ASP Secure Transmission - ‚ö†Ô∏è 70% Ready (need ASP partnership)
  - Corner 4: Invoice Receipt (AP Management) - üöß 40% Complete (database + APIs done)
  - Corner 5: FTA Submission - ‚ö†Ô∏è Handled by ASP Partner
- **Next Steps:** MFA implementation (Task 3), PEPPOL webhook handler (Task 4), PO management APIs (Task 5)

**October 27, 2025 - Tier 1 Production Hardening:**
- **Custom Exception Module (`utils/exceptions.py`):** Structured domain exceptions for better error handling and debugging (ValidationError, CryptoError, SigningError, CertificateError, XMLGenerationError, PeppolError, ConfigurationError).
- **Enhanced Crypto Utilities (`utils/crypto_utils.py`):** 
  - Certificate loading, validation, expiry checking, and metadata extraction
  - InvoiceCrypto now accepts and validates X.509 certificates at initialization
  - Environment key validation with development/production mode support
- **Environment Validation:** 
  - **Development Mode** (default): Warns about missing keys, continues with mocks
  - **Production Mode** (`PRODUCTION_MODE=true`): Fails hard if signing keys/certificates are missing
  - Validates certificate expiry at startup (warns if < 30 days to expiration)
- **UBL XML Generator:** Updated with structured error handling and better validation
- **PEPPOL Provider:** Added canonical error envelopes with error codes (TIMEOUT, NETWORK_ERROR) for observability
- **Global Exception Handler:** FastAPI automatically converts domain exceptions to structured HTTP responses
- **Required Environment Variables:**
  - `SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`: PEM-encoded RSA-2048 private key for invoice signing
  - `SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PEM`: PEM-encoded X.509 certificate for validation
  - `PRODUCTION_MODE`: Set to `true` to enforce strict validation (optional, defaults to false)

**Follow-Up Improvements (October 27, 2025):**
- **Automated Test Suite (`tests/test_crypto_validation.py`):** 11 comprehensive tests covering production mode validation, certificate expiry detection, metadata extraction, and InvoiceCrypto initialization. All tests passing.
- **Production Runbook (`docs/PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md`):** Complete operational guide for certificate management, rotation procedures, monitoring, troubleshooting, and security best practices.
- **KMS/HSM Migration Plan (`docs/KMS_ARCHITECTURE.md`):** Detailed architecture plan for migrating to AWS KMS/Azure Key Vault, including provider comparison, cost analysis, security benefits, and 6-8 week implementation timeline.
