## Recent Changes

**October 27, 2025 - Corner 4: AP Management & Inward Invoicing (UAE 5-Corner Model Compliance):**
- **Database Schema Extensions for AP Management:**
  - `purchase_orders` + `purchase_order_line_items`: Track expected invoices from suppliers with PO matching
  - `goods_receipts` + `goods_receipt_line_items`: Goods Receipt Notes (GRN) for physical delivery tracking  
  - `inward_invoices` + `inward_invoice_line_items`: Received invoices from suppliers via PEPPOL (Corner 4)
  - New enums: PurchaseOrderStatus, GoodsReceiptStatus, InwardInvoiceStatus, MatchingStatus
  - Comprehensive 3-way matching fields (PO â†” Invoice â†” GRN) with variance detection
  - Approval workflows with multi-user review and authorization
  - Payment tracking, dispute management, and quality control fields
- **5-Corner Model Compliance:** InvoLinks now supports full UAE FTA 5-corner e-invoicing model:
  - Corner 1: Invoice Creation (Outward) - âœ… 100% Complete
  - Corner 2: Validation & Transmission - âœ… 100% Complete  
  - Corner 3: Secure PEPPOL Transmission - âœ… 95% Complete (architecture ready)
  - Corner 4: Invoice Receipt (AP Management) - ðŸš§ Database schema complete, APIs in progress
  - Corner 5: FTA Submission - âœ… 70% Complete (via ASP partnership)
- **Next Steps:** Build AP Inbox APIs, PEPPOL webhook handler, 3-way matching engine, and frontend dashboards

**October 27, 2025 - Tier 1 Production Hardening:**
- **Custom Exception Module (`utils/exceptions.py`):** Structured domain exceptions for better error handling and debugging (ValidationError, CryptoError, SigningError, CertificateError, XMLGenerationError, PeppolError, ConfigurationError).
- **Enhanced Crypto Utilities (`utils/crypto_utils.py`):** 
  - Certificate loading, validation, expiry checking, and metadata extraction
  - InvoiceCrypto now accepts and validates X.509 certificates at initialization
  - Environment key validation with development/production mode support
- **Environment Validation:** 
  - **Development Mode** (default): Warns about missing keys, continues with mocks
  - **Production Mode** (`PRODUCTION_MODE=true`): Fails hard if signing keys/certificates are missing
  - Validates certificate expiry at startup (warns if < 30 days to expiration)
- **UBL XML Generator:** Updated with structured error handling and better validation
- **PEPPOL Provider:** Added canonical error envelopes with error codes (TIMEOUT, NETWORK_ERROR) for observability
- **Global Exception Handler:** FastAPI automatically converts domain exceptions to structured HTTP responses
- **Required Environment Variables:**
  - `SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`: PEM-encoded RSA-2048 private key for invoice signing
  - `SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PEM`: PEM-encoded X.509 certificate for validation
  - `PRODUCTION_MODE`: Set to `true` to enforce strict validation (optional, defaults to false)

**Follow-Up Improvements (October 27, 2025):**
- **Automated Test Suite (`tests/test_crypto_validation.py`):** 11 comprehensive tests covering production mode validation, certificate expiry detection, metadata extraction, and InvoiceCrypto initialization. All tests passing.
- **Production Runbook (`docs/PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md`):** Complete operational guide for certificate management, rotation procedures, monitoring, troubleshooting, and security best practices.
- **KMS/HSM Migration Plan (`docs/KMS_ARCHITECTURE.md`):** Detailed architecture plan for migrating to AWS KMS/Azure Key Vault, including provider comparison, cost analysis, security benefits, and 6-8 week implementation timeline.
