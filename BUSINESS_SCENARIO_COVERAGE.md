## Missing Features Analysis

4. **Project Management** - No task/project tracking
5. **Time Tracking** - No employee time sheets
6. **Manufacturing** - No BOM (Bill of Materials) or production planning
7. **Point of Sale (POS)** - Not a full POS system (but can invoice quickly)
8. **Delivery Management** - No route planning or logistics
