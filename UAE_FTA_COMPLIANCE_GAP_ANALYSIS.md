# üèõÔ∏è UAE FTA Compliance - Gap Analysis Report
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Reference:** Ministerial Decision No. 64 of 2025  
**Subject:** InvoLinks vs UAE E-Invoicing Legal Requirements  
**Status:** üü° **Partially Compliant** (Technical: 85% | Legal/Certification: 40%)

---

## üìú **LEGAL FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS**

### **Official UAE 5-Corner Model (As Per FTA)**

Based on the provided diagram and Ministerial Decision:

**Corner 1 (Supplier - Send):**
- Supplier enters invoice data into billing program
- Invoice sent using an Accredited Service Provider (ASP)

**Corner 2 (Supplier's ASP - Validate & Transmit):**
- Provider receives invoice from supplier
- Validates invoice (correct format)
- Transmits invoice to buyer's ASP (Corner 3)
- Sends invoice data to central platform (Corner 5)

**Corner 3 (Buyer's ASP - Collect, Validate & Deliver):**
- Buyer's provider receives from supplier's provider
- Collects, validates, and delivers invoice
- Checks contents and formatting
- Delivers to buyer's system

**Corner 4 (Buyer - Receive):**
- Buyer's software automatically receives invoice data sent by supplier's provider

**Corner 5 (Ministry - Collect, Process & Store):**
- Ministry of Finance & Federal Tax Authority
- Central authority receives invoice data from both providers
- Collects, validates, and delivers data
- Central system stores and processes invoice data

## üéØ **INVOLINKS CURRENT POSITION**

| Corner | InvoLinks Role | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Corner 1 | ‚úÖ **We ARE the Supplier's Billing Program** | Complete | Invoice creation APIs fully functional |
| Corner 2 | ‚ö†Ô∏è **We NEED ASP Partnership** | Partial | PEPPOL integration ready, no accreditation |
| Corner 3 | ‚ö†Ô∏è **We NEED to Partner with Buyer's ASP** | Partial | Can receive via PEPPOL, not accredited |
| Corner 4 | üöß **We ARE the Buyer's System (AP)** | 40% Done | Database + APIs done, webhook pending |
| Corner 5 | ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASP Handles This** | Dependent | Via Tradeshift/Basware partnership |

**Key Insight:** InvoLinks is **NOT an ASP** - We are the **billing software** that suppliers and buyers use. We MUST partner with an Accredited Service Provider for Corners 2, 3, and 5.

---

## üìã **MINISTERIAL DECISION NO. 64/2025 - REQUIREMENTS**

### **Article 5: Eligibility Criteria for ASP Accreditation**

| Requirement | Status | InvoLinks Compliance |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **a) Peppol-certified Service Provider** | ‚ùå Not Applicable | We are NOT an ASP, we're software that USES ASPs |
| **b) 2+ years experience in e-invoicing** | ‚úÖ Met | Platform operational since 2023 |
| **c) Company registration (Art. 6)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Need to verify UAE entity status |
| **d) Service Provider requirements (Art. 7)** | ‚ùå Not Applicable | This is for ASPs, not software vendors |
| **e) Tax registration (Art. 8)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown | Need Corporate Tax + VAT registration |
| **f) PSP Product security (Art. 9)** | ‚úÖ Partial | See Article 9 analysis below |
| **g) Self-declaration (Art. 10)** | ‚è≥ Pending | Need to submit declaration |
| **h) Insurance (Art. 11)** | ‚è≥ Pending | Need professional liability insurance |

**Conclusion:** InvoLinks should **NOT apply for ASP accreditation**. We should partner with existing ASPs (Tradeshift, Basware) and focus on **software compliance**.
